## Key Concepts Summary

### Docker Fundamentals
- **Images**: Read-only templates for containers
- **Containers**: Running instances of images
- **Layers**: How Docker images are structured
- **Registry**: Where images are stored and shared

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Image management
docker build -t image-name .
docker images
docker rmi image-name

# Container management
docker run -d -p 8080:80 image-name
docker ps
docker stop container-id
docker rm container-id

# Volume management
docker volume create volume-name
docker run -v volume-name:/app/data image-name

# Network management
docker network create network-name
docker run --network network-name image-name
```

### Data Management
- **Named Volumes**: Persistent data storage
- **Bind Mounts**: Host directory connections
- **Anonymous Volumes**: Temporary data storage
- **Volume Management**: Creating, listing, removing volumes

### Networking
- **Bridge Networks**: Default container communication
- **Host Networks**: Direct host network access
- **Custom Networks**: Isolated network environments
- **Service Discovery**: Container name resolution

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
```

## Learning Outcomes Review

### What You Can Now Do
- **Build and run containers** from images
- **Create custom images** using Dockerfiles
- **Manage data persistence** with volumes
- **Configure container networking** for communication
- **Orchestrate multi-container applications** with Docker Compose
- **Deploy containers** to various environments
- **Use utility containers** for development tasks

### Best Practices
- **Security**: Use non-root users, scan images
- **Performance**: Optimize image layers, use multi-stage builds
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates, cleanup unused resources
- **Documentation**: Clear Dockerfiles, README files
