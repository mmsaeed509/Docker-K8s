# 07 - Working with Utility Containers & Executing Commands In Containers

**Section Explanation:**
This section explores the concept of utility containers—specialized containers for tasks like building, testing, or running scripts. You'll learn how to execute commands inside containers and integrate these patterns into your development workflow.

---

## Section Overview
Utility containers are specialized Docker containers designed to perform specific tasks or provide particular tools. This module teaches you how to create and use utility containers, execute commands in containers, and integrate them into your development and deployment workflows using Docker Compose.

### ENTRYPOINT vs CMD in Docker

### What are ENTRYPOINT and CMD?
Both `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` are instructions in a Dockerfile that define what command gets executed when a container starts. However, they serve different purposes and interact in specific ways.

- **ENTRYPOINT**: Sets the main command to run in the container. It is intended to be the primary executable, making the container behave like that command.
- **CMD**: Provides default arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`, or, if `ENTRYPOINT` is not set, acts as the command to run. It can be overridden at runtime.

### Key Differences
- **ENTRYPOINT** is *not* easily overridden at runtime (unless you use `--entrypoint` in `docker run`). It is best for containers that should always run a specific executable.
- **CMD** is easily overridden by providing arguments to `docker run`.
- When both are present, `CMD` provides *default arguments* to `ENTRYPOINT`.

### Example 1: CMD Only
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM alpine
CMD ["echo", "Hello from CMD!"]
```
- **Behavior:**
  - `docker run myimage` → prints `Hello from CMD!`
  - `docker run myimage echo Goodbye` → prints `Goodbye`

### Example 2: ENTRYPOINT Only
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello from ENTRYPOINT!"]
```
- **Behavior:**
  - `docker run myimage` → prints `Hello from ENTRYPOINT!`
  - `docker run myimage Goodbye` → prints `Hello from ENTRYPOINT! Goodbye`
  - You cannot override the command without `--entrypoint`.

### Example 3: ENTRYPOINT and CMD Together
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Default from CMD"]
```
- **Behavior:**
  - `docker run myimage` → prints `Default from CMD`
  - `docker run myimage Hello World` → prints `Hello World`
  - Here, `CMD` provides default arguments to `ENTRYPOINT`.

### Example 4: Overriding ENTRYPOINT
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Always this"]
CMD ["unless overridden"]
```
- **Behavior:**
  - `docker run myimage` → prints `Always this unless overridden`
  - `docker run myimage something else` → prints `Always this something else`
  - `docker run --entrypoint /bin/sh myimage -c 'echo custom'` → prints `custom`

### Example 5: Shell Form vs Exec Form
- **Shell form:**
  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT echo "Shell form"
  CMD echo "Shell CMD"
  ```
  - Runs in a shell (`/bin/sh -c`), so environment variables and shell features are available.
- **Exec form:**
  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Exec form"]
  CMD ["Exec CMD"]
  ```
  - No shell, arguments are passed directly as an array.

### Summary Table
| Scenario | ENTRYPOINT | CMD | `docker run myimage` | `docker run myimage foo` |
|----------|------------|-----|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1        |    -       | ["echo", "bar"] | echo bar | echo foo |
| 2        | ["echo"]    | ["bar"] | echo bar | echo foo |
| 3        | ["echo", "bar"] | - | echo bar | echo bar foo |

### Best Practices
- Use **ENTRYPOINT** for the main command your container should always run (e.g., a server, script, or utility).
- Use **CMD** for default arguments or as a fallback command.
- Combine both for flexible containers: `ENTRYPOINT` as the executable, `CMD` as default arguments.
- Use the **exec form** (JSON array) for both to avoid issues with signal handling and argument parsing.

### Integration with Docker Compose
- **Using Docker Compose**
  - Integrating utility containers into Compose workflows
  - Service dependencies and execution order
  - Multi-service utility container patterns

### Advanced Concepts
- **Utility Containers, Permissions & Linux**
  - Permission handling in containers
  - Linux-specific considerations
  - Security implications and best practices
