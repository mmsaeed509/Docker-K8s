# 04 - Networking: (Cross-)Container Communication

**Section Explanation:**
This section explains how Docker containers communicate with each other, the host, and the outside world. You'll learn about Docker networking, service discovery, and how to connect multiple containers in real-world scenarios.

This section covers **Docker networking** and how containers communicate with each other and external systems. You'll learn about different communication scenarios, Docker networks, and how to enable efficient cross-container communication in your applications.

---

## Section Overview
Networking is essential for multi-container applications. This module explores three main communication scenarios: containers talking to the internet, containers communicating with the host machine, and containers talking to each other. You'll learn about Docker's networking capabilities and how to implement elegant solutions for container communication.
