# 11 - Getting Started with Kubernetes

**Section Explanation:**
This section introduces Kubernetes, explaining why it's needed and what problems it solves in modern infrastructure. You'll get a high-level understanding of Kubernetes architecture, terminology, and the challenges of scaling containers.

This section introduces **Kubernetes**, the leading container orchestration platform. You'll learn why Kubernetes is needed, what problems it solves, and understand its core architecture and concepts.

---

## Section Overview
This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes, explaining the challenges of manual container deployment at scale and how Kubernetes addresses these issues. You'll learn about Kubernetes architecture, core concepts, and the fundamental building blocks that make up a Kubernetes cluster.

## Kubernetes Fundamentals

### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Key Benefits
- **Automated Scaling**: Automatically scale applications based on demand
- **High Availability**: Ensure applications are always available
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service discovery and load balancing
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource allocation and utilization
- **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime deployments and updates

### Architecture Overview

#### Master Node (Control Plane)
- **API Server**: Central communication hub
- **etcd**: Distributed key-value store for cluster data
- **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes
- **Controller Manager**: Manages cluster state

#### Worker Nodes
- **Kubelet**: Node agent for pod management
- **Container Runtime**: Docker, containerd, or CRI-O
- **Kube-proxy**: Network proxy for service communication

## Core Concepts

### Pods
- Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Share network and storage resources

### Services
- Abstract way to expose applications
- Load balancing across pods
- Service discovery within the cluster

### Deployments
- Manage pod replicas
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Self-healing capabilities

### Namespaces
- Virtual clusters within a physical cluster
- Resource isolation and organization
- Access control and quotas

## How to Use These Resources
- **Start with the introduction** to understand the learning path
- **Follow the problem identification** to understand why Kubernetes is needed
- **Study the architecture** to understand how Kubernetes works
- **Use the cheat sheet** as a quick reference
- **Review the slides** for comprehensive coverage
- **Reference the HTML guides** for detailed explanations
