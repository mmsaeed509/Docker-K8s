# 09 - Deploying Docker Containers

**Section Explanation:**
This section covers how to deploy Docker containers to production environments, from manual server setups to managed cloud services. You'll learn about deployment strategies, cloud integration, and best practices for running containers in production.

This comprehensive module guides you through the entire deployment journey, starting with manual deployment on virtual machines and progressing to managed container services like AWS ECS. You'll learn about multi-stage builds, production optimizations, load balancing, and cloud-native deployment patterns.
