# 08 - A More Complex Setup: A Laravel & PHP Dockerized Project

**Section Explanation:**
This section demonstrates how to containerize a real-world, multi-service PHP/Laravel application using Docker. You'll learn to set up web servers, databases, and utility containers, and see how to manage a production-grade stack.

This section demonstrates building a **complex multi-container application** using Laravel, PHP, MySQL, and Nginx. You'll learn how to containerize a real-world PHP application with multiple services, utility containers, and advanced Docker Compose configurations.

---

## Section Overview
This module takes you through building a complete Laravel application with a sophisticated container architecture. You'll learn how to set up Nginx as a web server, PHP-FPM for application processing, MySQL for the database, and utility containers for development tasks. This represents a production-ready containerized PHP application setup.

2. Configure PHP-FPM container
3. Add MySQL database service

### Phase 3: Development Workflow
1. Implement Composer utility container
2. Add development utility containers
3. Configure development workflows

### Phase 4: Advanced Configuration
1. Optimize Docker Compose setup
2. Implement production considerations
3. Apply best practices and fixes
