# 03 - Managing Data & Working with Volumes

**Section Explanation:**
This section teaches you how Docker handles data, including the use of volumes for data persistence and sharing. You'll explore different types of data, learn how to keep your data safe across container restarts, and master best practices for development and production.

---

## Section Overview
Data management is crucial in containerized applications. This module explores how Docker handles different types of data, introduces volumes as a solution for data persistence, and covers advanced topics like bind mounts, environment variables, and build arguments. You'll work with a real application to understand practical data management scenarios.
